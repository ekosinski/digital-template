<h2>Alien Issues</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Travel around space learning how to fly your ship again.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Unorthodox controls, allow for different gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Alien Issues is a mix of the classic sci-fi space mover, and also a point collecting game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
As the player you have the ability to move in the ship in different directions.  You'll notice the ship has very unorthodox controls.  This is due to our main character forgetting how to fly his spaceship.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Alien Issues is about testing the wierd movement of the spaceship.  The spaceship is only able to move in diagonal directions creating difficulty in reaching the objects needed around the spaceship while also dodging the dark spheres.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Unlike most video games that focus on clear, and smooth controls Alien Issues focuses on its difficult controls.  Even such a normal objective such as dodging small spheres and collecting spheres becomes difficult with these bad controls. Players can explore the physocology of how badly a player is affected by slightly off controls.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Alien Issues takes place in the future.  Although our main character Maxwell is an ace pilot he recently landed neart a strange nebula that erased all of his memories.  Needing to return to his home planet Maxwell attempts to gather nearby energy to fuel his flight home.  Unfortunaty due to his recently memory loss Maxwell has a very hard time flying.  Maxwell must continue to try to master his ability to fly while gathering fuel in the massive nebula.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Maxwell must collect his fuel to return home.  The story is quite simple in that Maxwell has an end goal and beggining goal.  After some hours of collecting fuel Maxwell does return home to his family, and regains his flight skills.
</li>

Alien Issues appeases to young children due to its simple story and gameplay.
</li>

Alien Issues will include about half an hour worth of levels.
</li>
